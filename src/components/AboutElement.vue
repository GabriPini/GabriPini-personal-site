          My name is Gabriele Pini and I have recently completed an online
          accademy with BooleanCareers. I have a passion for all things
          technology and design, from software engineering to UI/UX. In addition
          to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in
          videogames. Below are details of some of the projects I have developed
          during my coding experience.
